# A demo ProtoGalaxy implementation in Python and SageMath
Reference https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1106.pdf for details.

Project status: implementation relatively complete; now debugging and benching

## Todo: 
- generate some passing proof data
- add tests
- make loud noises on Twitter about rewriting in Rust, they eat that shit up
- forget about the project
- translate to Rust
